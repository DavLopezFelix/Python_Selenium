Introduction:

- The scripts utilize the Page Object Model (POM) to test the login and dashboard functionality of a webpage in both Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers. 
- POM is a design pattern that helps organize and maintain automated tests by separating page elements and actions into reusable objects.
- By implementing POM, the scripts enhance code maintainability and test efficiency across different browsers.

Prerequisites:

- Python 3
- pip 22

Step to run:
- Clone the repository to your local directory.
- Open the local directory using your preferred code editor, such as Visual Studio Code (VSC).
- Install all the required dependencies by running the following command: pip install -r requirements.txt.
- Execute the test file by running the command: pytest Tests -v --html=./hubSpot.html.
- The test report will be generated as hubSpot.html.

Following these steps will allow you to clone the repository, set up the necessary dependencies, and run the test file using pytest.
The resulting test report will be saved as hubSpot.html.
